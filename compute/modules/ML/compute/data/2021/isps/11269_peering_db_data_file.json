Will not enter a bi-lateral peering contract unless traffic is greater than 1000 Mbps. Reserve the right to disconnect peer with 30 days notice . Peer must be professionally managed by a 24x7 NOC. Peer must agree to repair or otherwise remedy any problems within a reasonable timeframe. Peer must also agree to actively cooperate to resolve security incidents, denial of service attacks, and other operational problems. No transit or third party routes are to be announced; all routes exchanged must be peer's and peer's customers' routes. Neither party shall abuse the peering relationship by engaging in activities such as but not limited to: pointing a default route at the other or otherwise forwarding traffic for destinations not explicitly advertised. Meeting the above criteria is not a guarantee that a peering relationship with LinkBermuda will be established.
