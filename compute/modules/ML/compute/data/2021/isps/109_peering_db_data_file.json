Cisco is actively expanding its peering footprint globally across Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific.  At this time a selective peering policy has been chosen where Cisco will limit the number of bilateral peers. Cisco will not be peering through exchange route servers.\n\nGeneral Terms:\n* Peering agreements will be reviewed yearly to ensure traffic requirements are maintained.\n* Cisco reserves the right to modify this policy at any time without notice.  \n* Compliance with the terms of this policy does not guarantee a peering relationship with Cisco.  This policy is a guideline and Cisco may refuse peering for any reason without disclosure.\n* Peering may be temporarily or permanently disconnected by either party for any reason.\n* Cisco and Requester agree not to abuse the peering relationship.  Examples of abusive behavior are, but are not limited to: static routes, default routes, improper filtering,  and willfully sending malicious traffic.\n\nGuidelines and Requirements:\n* Cisco shall maintain accurate contact information and POP presence at peeringdb.com.\n* Both IPv4 and IPv6 peering is preferred at all exchanges.\n* Cisco advertises regional prefixes in each exchange location and will not provide consistent advertisements across regions.\n* Cisco does not expect consistent advertisements from peers.\n* Cisco (AS109) will only accept and advertise prefixes for AS109 and will not act as transit for any other ASNs.\n* Requester must be connected to an Internet Exchange where Cisco (AS109) presently peers as listed on peeringdb.com.\n* Requester must operate a 24x7 Network Operation Center and must respond to all reported issues within 24 hours.\n* Requester must maintain a peeringdb.com record with accurate contact information and public peering exchange point details.\n* Multi-lateral peering is strongly preferred in all instances, even where traffic levels meet bi-lateral peering requirements.\n* Requester must meet minimum bandwidth requirements based upon each interconnection point per region.  Bandwidth will be assessed upon the 95th percentile bitrate over the previous 90 days prior to the receipt of the request.  The higher bitrate of the ingress or egress 95th percentile value will be the basis of consideration.  \n\nRegional rate requirements are as follows:\n\nAsia Pacific:\n* A minimum of 10 mbps will be required for multi-lateral peering.\n* A minimum of 100 mbps will be required for bi-lateral peering.\nEurope:\n* A minimum of 30 mbps is required for multi-lateral peering.\n* A minimum of 150 mbps is required for bi-lateral peering.\t\nLatin America:\n* A minimum of 10 mbps is required for multi-lateral peering.\n* A minimum of 100 mbps is required for bi-lateral peering.\nMiddle East & Africa:\n* A minimum of 10 mbps is required for multi-lateral peering.\n* A minimum of 100 mbps is required for bi-lateral peering.\nNorth America:\n* A minimum of 100 mbps is required for multi-lateral peering.\n* A minimum of 300 mbps is required for bi-lateral peering.\t\n\nRequesting Peering:\nAll requests which meet the guidelines and requirements must be e-mailed to as109-peering@cisco.com and must contain the following information:\n* Requester's ASN and all proposed ASNs to be advertised.\n* List of common interconnection points.\n* Ingress and egress bitrates, based upon 95th percentile, per requested exchange points over prior 90 days.\n* Maximum number of prefixes expected to be advertised.\n* Description of type of traffic carried by requester's network.\n* Authentication support\n\nRequests which meet the minimum bandwidth requirements for peering will be reviewed. If approved, Cisco will contact you. Unfortunately, due to the number of requests we receive, we may not be able to respond to all requests.", "created": "2013-01-08T10:51:05Z", "org_id": 8574, "policy_url": "", "info_never_via_route_servers": false, "poc_updated": "2020-01-22T04:24:11Z", "info_type": "enterprise", "policy_contracts": "Not Required", "info_prefixes6": 5, "aka": "Cisco", "info_prefixes4": 100, "info_ipv6": true, "irr_as_set": "AS-CISCO", "pop_list": [{"city": "Ashburn", "country": "US", "state": "VA", "org_name": "Equinix, Inc.", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 1, "location": [39.02, -77.46], "port_capacity": 21000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.852}, {"city": "Dallas", "country": "US", "state": "TX", "org_name": "Equinix, Inc.", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 4, "location": [32.8, -96.82], "port_capacity": 21000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8170000000000001}, {"city": "San Jose", "country": "US", "state": "CA", "org_name": "Equinix, Inc.", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 6, "location": [37.24, -121.78], "port_capacity": 21000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.838}, {"city": "Raleigh", "country": "US", "state": "NC", "org_name": "Lumen Technologies Inc", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 6747, "location": [35.85, -78.6], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8140000000000001}, {"city": "Los Angeles", "country": "US", "state": "CA", "org_name": "CoreSite LLC", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 19, "location": [34.05, -118.26], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.838}, {"city": "Morrisville", "country": "US", "state": "NC", "org_name": "Flexential Corp.", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 5007, "location": [35.85, -78.83], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8140000000000001}, {"city": "San Jose", "country": "US", "state": "CA", "org_name": "CoreSite LLC", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 20, "location": [37.33, -121.89], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.838}, {"city": "Dallas", "country": "US", "state": "TX", "org_name": "Lumen Technologies Inc", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 1021, "location": [32.81, -96.87], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8170000000000001}, {"city": "New York", "country": "US", "state": "NY", "org_name": "Equinix, Inc.", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 38, "location": [40.74, -74.0], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.802}, {"city": "Somerville", "country": "US", "state": "MA", "org_name": "CoreSite LLC", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 584, "location": [42.38, -71.08], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.784}, {"city": "Sunnyvale", "country": "US", "state": "CA", "org_name": "Lumen Technologies Inc", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 176, "location": [37.37, -121.99], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.838}], "prefixes": 77, "total_prefixes_in_globe": 8388478, "address_space": 1149696, "total_addresses_in_globe": 22264797636, "neighbor": 25}
