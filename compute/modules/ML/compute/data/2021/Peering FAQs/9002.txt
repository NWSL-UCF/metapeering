AS9002 peering policy
Overview
RETN owns and operates an IP network identified as Autonomous System 9002 with AS-RETN as-set (IPv4) and AS-RETN6 (IPv6).
Our IP network is directly interconnected with multiple ISPs, NSPs and CSPs. New peering connections are established, only when they are beneficial for RETN and its customers.
RETN has a restrictive peering policy globally and considers each peering request based upon individual merits. Below are the main principles which determine RETNâs decision regarding the benefits and appropriateness of establishing peering with potential partners.
We reserve the right to reject a peering request or terminate existing peering relationships if their advantages are not evident to us.
Basic requirements
Those who request private peering with RETN, whether over a PNI or IXP, should:
â¢ Have minimum traffic volumes of 8Gbps with RETN;
â¢ Have balanced traffic with AS9002, with a minimum ratio of 50%;
â¢ Have implemented MANRS actions and be a participant of MANRS (manrs.org);
â¢ Secure a minimum of 10Gbps bandwidth at each interconnection point;
â¢ Maintain a network consisting of fully redundant N x 100G links with each peering point;
â¢ Establish interconnection with RETN in 3 separate mutually beneficial locations which are geographically separated by at least 2000km from each other;
â¢ Be able to react quickly to establish additional capacity to meet traffic growth, and agree to upgrade connections at 70% utilisation;
â¢ Maintain âfull BGP viewâ at the edge router by means of BGPv4;
â¢ Announce only its own routes and the routes of its customers to AS9002, but not the routes received from other peers or upstreams;
â¢ Not announce âmartianâ routes or the default route (0.0.0.0/0) to AS9002;
â¢ Manage a fully staffed 24Ã7 Network Operational Centre;
â¢ Provide its escalation matrix upon request in order to be able to quickly resolve possible network issues;
â¢ Agree RETN peering conditions in a formal interconnection agreement;
â¢ Be beneficial for RETN and our Customers.
