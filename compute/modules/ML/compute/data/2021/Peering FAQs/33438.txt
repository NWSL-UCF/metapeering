Peering Policy
September 14, 2020
STACKPATH PEERING [AS33438]
Peering is the direct interconnection between StackPath’s network (AS33438) and another network for the purpose of exchanging traffic between these networks.
StackPath peers at the internet exchanges and peering facilities listed in PeeringDB.
To express interest in public or private (PNI) peering with StackPath, please contact peering@stackpath.com
1. Peering Policy
StackPath has a selective peering policy. Peers are selected based upon the amount of traffic exchanged with StackPath’s network, capability and mutual benefit for both networks.
StackPath’s general technical requirements for peering are:
A publicly routable ASN.
Current and complete peeringdb.com.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported (and expected).
Unless specifically agreed upon beforehand, peers are expected to announce consistent routes in all locations where they peer with StackPath.
MD5 is not required but is available upon request.
A fully redundant network with sufficient capacity to exchange traffic without congestion.
A knowledgeable and fully staffed 24x7x365 Network Operations Center (NOC), capable of assisting in the resolution of:
All technical and performance issues.
All security violations, denial of service attacks, or any other abuse originating within the peers network or their customers networks.
2. Traffic requirements for public peering
< 1Gbps of traffic, StackPath invites you to use our routes available on the internet exchange route servers.
> 1Gbps of traffic and < 10Gbps, StackPath invites you to contact us to establish a direct BGP session between our ASN’s.
3. Traffic requirements for private (PNI) peering
> 5Gbps of traffic, StackPath invites you to contact us to work out the options and terms for a private interconnect between our ASN’s.
Private (PNI) interconnects must be single mode, 10Gbps (10G-LR) or 100Gbps (100G-LR4). StackPath will consider 40G (40G-LR4) interconnects after technical justification and review has been performed.
It is preferred that all private interconnects (PNI’s) are to be deployed redundantly whenever possible.
Peers are expected to upgrade their PNI ports with StackPath when peak utilization exceeds 50%.
4. Routing Policy
In general, peering sessions with StackPath (AS33438) will advertise all AS-HIGHWINDS routes.
5. Traffic Management
Where possible, StackPath prefers to carry traffic on its network to interconnection points as close to users as possible.
StackPath recommends that peers advertise all of their prefixes over all peering sessions, unless other route advertisement policies have been agreed upon.
6. Maximum Prefix
We suggest peers set a max-prefix of 25000 (IPv4) and 5000 (IPv6) routes on peering sessions with StackPath.
7. Related ASNs
StackPath also manages the following ASNs: 12989, 20446 and 54104.
