Peering Information:
Online Technology Exchange - Your direct internet source operates using the autonomous system AS32494.
We have an open peering policy, requiring a minimum of 50 Mbps of in-continent traffic destined to or through your network.
We require an up-to-date PeeringDB entry for all public peering requests, including exchange information with properly formatted public fabric addresses, ASNs, and NOC / peering contact information. Please be patient when setting up peering, they can be instant or could take up to 48 Hours.
We ask that peers also maintain their private peering facility details, as we use this information for private peering (PNI) targeting.
