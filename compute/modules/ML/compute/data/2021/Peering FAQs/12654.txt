RIS Peering Policy
The peering policy for the Routing Information System (RIS) along with peering information for all RRCs.
https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/ris-peering-policy
https://www.ripe.net/logo.png
RIS Peering Policy
Please announce all your IPv4 and IPv6 BGP routes to the RRC. With this information, our global visibility calculations become more accurate and it helps other AS operators to ensure that their prefixes are visible on your network. The use of TCP MD5 signatures is not supported. Participating peers will be listed on the RIS webpages. All BGP traffic will be recorded, stored in the RIS Database and made available to the Internet community.
If you have questions about details, please do not hesitate to contact us for guidance.
Routing Beacons
Expect to see a small number of prefixes (a subset of those listed in the AS12654:RS-RIS object in the RIPE Database) being announced in your direction. These are "Routing Beacons", mainly used for BGP convergence and flap damping studies. If possible, please treat the beacon prefixes as normal customer prefixes by providing transit for them and announcing them to your peers, customers and transit providers as appropriate. Only a very small amount of traffic to or from these prefixes may be seen while they are used for reachability tests.
For peering with the RIS project, use our peering form.
To contact us about peering or other issues, send an e-mail to ris _at_ ripe _dot_ net.
