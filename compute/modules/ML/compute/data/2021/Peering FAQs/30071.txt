Peering Policy
Thank you for your interest in establishing peering with OCCAID (AS30071).
Below you will find the relevant contact information and guidelines used to qualify peering applications.
For your information, OCCAID uses IRR AS-SET object AS-OCCAID6 for its IPv6 routes and AS-OCCAID for its IPv4 routes. Additionally, OCCAID advertises approximately 180 IPv6 unicast routes, 1 IPv6 multicast routes, 65 IPv4 unicast routes and 0 IPv4 multicast routes at this time.

OCCAID IPv4 Peering Policy
The guidelines for establishing IPv4 peering with OCCAID are as follows:
1. Intro: Peering IPv4 with OCCAID gives your customers quicker access to IPv6 tunneling service points throughout the US, including some of SixXS POPs in the United States.
2. OCCAID will only peer IPv4 with (a) networks with existing IPv6 peering arrangement; (b) OCCAID2 site connectors; and/or (c) IPv4 networks that provide transit path for end-user IPv6 tunnels.
OCCAID IPv6 Peering Policy
The guidelines for establishing IPv6 peering with OCCAID are as follows:
1. OCCAID grants open peering policy to any one of the following:
Members of certain exchange points we're present at (contact us for details).
National Research & Education Networks (NRENs)
Defense and Governmental Institutions
2. Peering is bilateral. There is no MLPA or third-party regulation on bilateral interconnections.
3.
For all interconnect types (Public and Private), interconnection must occur at minimum of two (2) diverse locations that are not in the same metropolitan region.
For networks with international/global footprint, interconnection must occur at all continents where both networks maintain presence.
Specific exemptions may be made, at OCCAID's discretion, for International networks who operate solely in continental regions where OCCAID currently has limited presence, or does not interconnect with other networks.
4. The applicant's network must be able to reach all of its OCCAID interconnection points under a single continuant Autonomous System Number (ASN), and must not be a set of disconnected networks.
5. Must maintain minimum backbone capacity of OC-12/STM-4 (622 Mbps) links or greator between geographically dispersed metropolitan locations.
6. Peers who are exchanging 50Mbit/sec (in 95th percentile) in aggregate or more of IPv6 traffic with OCCAID will be asked to either: (a) exchange MEDs; or (b) balance traffic exchange rate to not exceed bidirectional ratio of 2:1.
7. Each interconnection (regardless of whether public or private) shall have no less than 100Mbit/s of capacity.
6. Must not be a member/participant of OCCAID which is receiving transit or commodity peering service.
8. MD5 password is not supported at all locations.
9. Operation of a 24x7x365 network operations center (NOC) that proactively monitors all interconnections and provides an escalation path to quickly identify and resolve network problems.
10. Must be able and willing to quickly trace and mitigate ongoing denial of service attacks and malicious network activities.
Must be able to provide a qualified engineer within a reasonable timeframe and be willing to take reasonable steps to mitigate attacks which are crossing over the interconnection--this includes reasonable placement of packet filters or blackhole routes upon request, and OCCAID will do the same.
11. Consistent route announcements at all peering locations.
12. Hot-potato is implied.
We will not accept or send MEDs.
13. Neither party shall announce to the other the more specific routes of prefixes learned via a third party transit customer.
14. Must not establish a static route, a route of last resort (i.e. default route), or otherwise send traffic over the interconnection for a route not advertised over BGP. Neither party shall alter, sell, or give next-hop to a third party. Neither party shall restrict nor otherwise temper with traffic bound to the other party. These activities are considered malicious and theft of service.
15. Must not readvertise OCCAID's prefixes to any parties which are not customers. Tunneled BGP 'peerings' without a business or sponsorship relationship to provide upstream service constitute NON-CUSTOMERS.
Peers and upstream transit providers also constitute NON-CUSTOMERS. Likewise, must only advertise customer and self-originated routes to OCCAID and vice versa.
16. Both parties should be willing to register route6 and related objects to IRR and update them consistently for the purpose of filtering. Also both parties should encourage their customers to do the same.
17. Peers who are unable to maintain these requirements are given 30 days written notice over email to rectify the situation. OCCAID reserves the right to depeer if situation is not cured within 30 days or within a reasonable extension which may be granted upon constant communication between both parties.
18. OCCAID reserves the right to temporarily suspend any or all interconnections without prior notice in the event that peer's network is causing material damages and/or operational harm to OCCAID.
Such suspended interconnections can be restored back into service as soon as both parties are assured that all operational issues are cured and cleared.
19. Meeting the guidelines above is not a guarantee that peering will be established. OCCAID reserves the right to not grant peering to an applicant based on business or operational reasons.
20. OCCAID reserves the right to make exceptions at its discretion to any particular peer or applicant. OCCAID further reserves the right to update its peering policies without notice at its discretion, as overall customer demand and network traffic conditions change.
