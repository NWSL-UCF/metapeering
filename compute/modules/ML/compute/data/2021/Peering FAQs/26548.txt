I've used one of the "big names" for years to help manage my hosting and design business, but with PureVoltage, I'm not only improving my speeds for customers, but saving on my wallet as well. They provide me everything I need, and nothing I don't, putting me in a perfect place to scale my business for the future.

I require a specific type of hosting for my business, and PureVoltage was not only able to accommodate my needs, but do it at a lower price, and better speeds. My database loads faster than ever before, and my productivity has increased because I am now not worried about my server needs, as PureVoltage has me covered.
