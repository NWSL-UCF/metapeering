Welcome
This website contains information about the M247 Ltd International Backbone (previously known as GlobalAXS Communications).
Until 2012 GlobalAXS Communications was a division of M247 Limited, the Manchester based Internet Infrastructure company with a broad range of offerings. To assist its customers to better understand their product range M247 is in the process of subsuming all of the GlobalAXS offering into one single M247 brand which will soon detail a full range of products which includes all of the connectivity products previously offered under the GlobalAXS badge such as Leased Lines, Partial IP Transit, Global IP Transit, Ethernet MPLS Backhaul.
All of the Points of Presence and network functionality fronted by the GlobalAXS badge will in future be visible under the M247 brand.
