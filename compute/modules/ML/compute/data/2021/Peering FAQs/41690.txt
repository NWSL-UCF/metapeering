Please note :
- We may route the traffic to other transit interfaces or delivery POPs/CDN when reaching 80% of bandwitdh utilization to prevent saturation.

- We usually  do not set up direct peering sessions when the amount of traffic is not above 1gbps on average for a week period. We have an open policy on route servers.

- We appreciate from the requester of direct peering, a minimum of traffic engineering information like amount of traffic exchanged on average and peak time.

- ipv6 is currently supported in Equinix Singapore SG1, Tokyo TY4, New-York NY9 and Coresite SV4.
