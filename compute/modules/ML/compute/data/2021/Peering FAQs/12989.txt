Each Order shall be subject to the provisions of the documents governing it in effect at the time of Order placement or use of Service, whichever occurs first, including without limitation the MSA, the SLA (if any) and Policies. For subsequent Orders, any earlier placed Orders still in effect shall become governed by the version of the governing documents prevailing at the time that subsequent Order is made.
2.2 Account Security.You are solely responsible for adequate security, protection and backup of Your Content and technology. We disclaim all responsibility or liability for any claims or losses related to Your Content or technology caused directly or indirectly by You or others. You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under Your account whether by authorized or unauthorized users.
2.3 Support and Availability.We will provide support for the Service, including providing bug fixes and updates, in accordance with the corresponding SLA (if any).
3. Term, Charges, Refunds and Taxes
3.1 Term.The duration of a Service (the “Term”) shall be indicated in the Order. The Term shall automatically renew for successive Terms until the Order is terminated according to Section 4 herein.
3.2 Charges.You authorize Us to charge any of the payment method(s) You have provided on a recurring basis for successive Terms, until the Order is terminated by You or Us. The amount charged may vary for reasons including but not limited to promotional offers, overages and/or changes to Your plan. You authorize StackPath to charge your payment method for such varying amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges. StackPath reserves the right to adjust pricing for a Service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as determined in Our sole and absolute discretion. Unless otherwise indicated on the Order, payment for all charges is due on the invoice date (“Due Date”). Charges may be disputed by providing Us with notice and supporting documentation within thirty (30) days of the Due Date. If a charge is not disputed in accordance with this Section 3.2, payment is due in full and You waive all rights to dispute the charge.
