Peering Policy
Interconnect with the Amazon global network
This document outlines Amazonâs policies and preferences for peering with external third parties on a settlement free basis (âAmazon Peering Policyâ or âAmazon Settlement Free Interconnection Policyâ) and includes the key factors that Amazon considers when assessing a request from external parties for peering with Amazonâs AS16509 network or any successor AS numbers (âAmazon AS16509â). In order to provide a highly available and high performance experience for our customers, Amazon maintains a global network infrastructure and peers with external networks, utilizing both public peering (Internet Exchanges) and private peering (Private Network Interconnect).

Peering Requests
Any external party that intends to peer with Amazon AS16509 must have an up-to-date and fully completed entry in peeringdb.com. All peering requests should come via email. Amazon will, in its sole discretion, assess peering requests and existing arrangements on a case-by-case basis considering the external partyâs adherence to the best practices below and other factors. Amazon endeavors to respond, either inclined or declined, to all peering requests on a timely basis; however, due to the number of requests that Amazon receives, Amazon will not respond to provide reasons as to why any individual peering request is declined.
Peering Best Practices
The following are best practices expected of Amazonâs peering partners:
Maintain an up-to-date and fully completed entry in peeringdb.com.
Use a unique public autonomous system number (âASNâ)
Operate a dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) network using a public ASN
Timely resolve issues raised in trouble tickets, with a 24x7 network support contact
Commit to interconnect with Amazon in all common locations where Amazon and the partner both have a point of presence
Maintain entries in Internet Routing Registries (âIRRâ) and use IRR entries for filtering across the partnerâs network(s)
Comply with the Peering Technical Guidelines in Appendix below.
Enable or have plans for enabling Resource Public Key Infrastructure (âRPKIâ) for route origin validation
Avoid malicious or otherwise undesirable traffic or activity on the partnerâs network
Peering Technical Guidelines
Amazon expects its peering partners to comply with the following technical guidelines which are based on best common practices for Internet eXchange Points (âIXPsâ). Public peering partners must adhere to the technical requirements of the respective IXPs that are used for interconnection and may only use the IPv4/v6 addresses assigned to them by those IXPs.
Routing
Support Border Gateway Protocol (âBGPâ) version 4 routing protocol for propagating routing information across the interconnection
Announce only the peering partnerâs own routes, its customer routes and any other network that has agreed to allow the partner to announce its routes to third parties
On public IXPs, a peering partner should only announce prefixes with its own next-hop IP address and not announce routes on behalf of other peers on the IXP
Support both IPv4 unicast and IPv6 unicast traffic as native or dual-stacked
Accept any appropriately IRR-registered prefix announcements up to /24 in length for IPv4 and /48 in length for IPv6
Employ a routing policy that ensures that traffic generally follows a closest-exit behavior.
Support BGP prefix filter updates using these IRRs, with automated router configuration updates occurring no less than every 24 hours: RADB, ALTDB, RIPE, APNIC and ARIN
Support BGP prefix filters using Route Origin Authorizations (âROAsâ) for origin ASN validation for directly connected peers, or use RPKI-based validation for all route and traffic exchange.
Forwarding
Forward traffic on interconnection interfaces only to routes being advertised across the interconnection. Any traffic destined for Amazonâs network will be forwarded via dynamic routing and not static routing. If a peering partner continues to send Amazon traffic over an interconnection to IP address after Amazon has withdrawn the prefixes, Amazon will not continue to peer with that external party.
Operational
Maintain a 24x7x365 operational contact on peeringdb.com. For private peers, Amazon prefers to have direct and multiple levels of contacts for policy, capacity, and operational discussion, including face-to-face annual meetings at peering conferences, network operators forums, IXP members meetings or a mutually agreed location.
Non-Routing Devices
Amazon will peer with looking glass and route-collectors only over IXPs. When a BGP speaker is collecting routing information for analysis and not for immediate routing decisions, the BGP speaker may use a private AS number and should not advertise any routes.
Additional Technical Guidelines for Private Peering
Physical Connection
Amazon does not support private peering interconnections at speeds that are less than 10Gbps.
New or existing peering partners may request a private interconnection for any location where both parties have a point of presence.
The cost of in-building cross connects will be shared equitably between Amazon and the partner.
The physical port requirements are:
All interfaces configured as auto negotiating
Optical interconnections with single-mode fiber
Use of standards based 10GBase-LR, and 100GBase-LR optics,although extended Range 10GBase-ER and 100GBase-ER4 optics may be considered on a case by case basis.
Support of IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation (LACP) or multipath to distribute load across multiple interconnect ports
Ethernet MAC Layer
One of the following ethertypes for all frames forwarded:
0x0800 â IPv4
0x0806 â ARP
0x86dd â IPv6
Same source MAC address for all frames forwarded. All link-aggregated ports for a partner are treated as a single port.
No forwarding of broadcast or multicast traffic
Link-local traffic limited to the following protocols:
ARP
IPv6 Neighbor solicitations and advertisements
Examples of other link-local protocols that should be disabled on the interconnection facing interfaces include: IRDP, ICMP redirects, IEEE802 Spanning Tree, Vendor proprietary discovery protocols (e.g. CDP, EDP), Interior routing protocol broadcasts (e.g. OSPF, ISIS, IGRP, EIGRP), BOOTP/DHCP, PIM-SM, PIM-DM, DVMRP
IP Address
Amazon prefers private interconnections to use /31 (preferred) or /30 for IPv4 link-local addresses, and /127 (preferred) or /64 for IPv6 link-local addresses. IPv6 site-local addresses will not be used. Domain Name System (âDNSâ) may be configured with mutual agreement between Amazon and the partner.
Additional Factors
In addition to the guidelines above, Amazon may consider other factors in agreeing to peer with external parties, such as these preferred specifications:
Peering partners should not prioritize any Internet traffic which passes across its backbone and customer links except for traffic associated with reasonable network management.
Peering partners should support a comprehensive and documented BGP community scheme for marking prefixes sent to peers, identifying:&nbsp; prefix origin (incl. City, State/Province, Country, Continent) and prefix type (customer, internal).
Peering partners should support BGP community triggered packet discard (blackholing) of traffic within the network supporting IPv4 prefixes up to /32 and IPv6 prefixes up to /128.
