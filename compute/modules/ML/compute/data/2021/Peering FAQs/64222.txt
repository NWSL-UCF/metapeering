Mega IX – Technical Details.
Traffic Forwarding Policy
The following Ethertypes are accepted and forwarded from customer ports:
0x0800 IPv4
0x86DD IPv6
0x0806 ARP
MAC Security Policy
To prevent unauthorized traffic from entering the exchange, MegaIX implements Layer2 MAC access-control lists and restricts each member port to a single MAC address. Customers who intend to swap routers or otherwise change their MAC address should coordinate this change via the Portal. If a customer cannot make the change via the portal, they can coordinate via the MegaIX support team.
Private VLAN
PVLAN services are offered to customers.
