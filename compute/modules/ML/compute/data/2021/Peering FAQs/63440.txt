This policy is subject to review based on technical, operational, and legal requirements.linkGeneral Peering and Interconnection RequirementsTelnyx requires peering to be implemented over an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) or private cross connection (XC).At each IXP, Telnyx will have two peer addresses for BGP sessions.
This design is for redundancy and no routing priority will be given on either peer via configuration.
We prefer sessions be established with both peers.IXP peering sessions must be implemented across all available exchanges.
Example: If we are members of multiple IXPs, then we require sessions to be established on all IXPs.linkTechnical RequirementsPeers must have a public, verifiable ASN Prefixes must be maintained in a public IRRPrefixes that will be announced must also be seen in the DFZ (Default Free Zone)Prefixes must not exceed a /24 in mask sizeCommunities will be sent by TelnyxAn accurate PeeringDB profile must be maintainedDo not announce a default route toward TelnyxPeers may use the AS-TELNYX macro list with RADB for Telnyx prefix listsCurrently our platform is implemented with IPv4 address space, but we also peer with IPv6 and announce our assigned blocks.linkOperational RequirementsPlease have a support 24x7 NOC contact that includes escalation details for troubleshooting connectivity and traffic issues.The Telnyx network team will respond and complete implementation within 48 hours.
Once the peering sessions have been established, we will accept and announce prefixes within 24 hours.Sessions that have not completed the initial implementation will be torn down within 5 business days.Sessions that are seen as down for a period of 5 business days will be torn down unless an ongoing maintenance window has been reported by the peering NOC.Telnyx will issue maintenance updates within 48 hours of planned work on our IXP or XC nodes.linkTelnyx IXP and XC Points of PresenceTelnyx POPs are available below and at (PeeringDB)Public Peering Exchange Points (IXPs)Equinix AshburnASN: 63440IPV4s:206.126.237.147206.126.237.154IPV6s:2001:504:0:2:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:2:0:6:3440:2Port Speed: 1gbEquinix ChicagoASN: 63440IPV4s:208.115.136.50208.115.136.208IPV6s:2001:504:0:4:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:4:0:6:3440:2Port Speed: 1gbEquinix San JoseASN: 63440IPV4s:206.223.116.110206.223.117.18IPV6s:2001:504:0:1:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:1:0:6:3440:2Port Speed: 1gbEquinix SingaporeASN: 63440IPV4s:27.111.229.10127.111.229.99IPV6s:2001:de8:4::6:3440:12001:de8:4::6:3440:2Port Speed: 1gbEquinix SydneyASN: 63440IPV4s:45.127.173.3045.127.173.31IPV6s:2001:de8:6::6:3440:12001:de8:6::6:3440:2Port Speed: 1gbLINX LON1 MainASN: 63440IPV4s:195.66.227.165IPV6s:2001:7f8:4::f7d0:1Port Speed: 1gbLINX NoVAASN: 63440IPV4s:206.55.196.59IPV6s:2001:504:31::f7d0:1Port Speed: 1gbTorIXASN: 63440IPV4s:206.108.35.93IPV6s:2001:504:1a::35:93Port Speed: 1gbVANIXASN: 63440IPV4s:206.41.104.83206.41.104.84IPV6s:2001:504:39::832001:504:39::84Port Speed: 1gbExchangeASNIPV4IPV6Port SpeedEquinix Ashburn63440206.126.237.147206.126.237.1542001:504:0:2:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:2:0:6:3440:21gbEquinix Chicago63440208.115.136.50208.115.136.2082001:504:0:4:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:4:0:6:3440:21gbEquinix San Jose63440206.223.116.110206.223.117.182001:504:0:1:0:6:3440:12001:504:0:1:0:6:3440:21gbEquinix Singapore6344027.111.229.10127.111.229.992001:de8:4::6:3440:12001:de8:4::6:3440:21gbEquinix Sydney6344045.127.173.3045.127.173.312001:de8:6::6:3440:12001:de8:6::6:3440:21gbLINX LON1 Main63440195.66.227.1652001:7f8:4::f7d0:11gbLINX NoVA63440206.55.196.592001:504:31::f7d0:11gbTorIX63440206.108.35.932001:504:1a::35:931gbVANIX63440206.41.104.83206.41.104.842001:504:39::832001:504:39::841gbPrivate Peering FacilitiesLocationPort SpeedEquinix Ashburn10gbEquinix Chicago10gbEquinix San Jose10gbCologix VAN210gbEquinix Toronto10gbEquinix London10gblinkContact UsDonât hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!Live chat in Mission ControlSupportsupport@telnyx.com1.312.945.74201.888.980.9750Salessales@telnyx.com1.312.945.7420Log inSign upTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyÂ© Telnyx LLC, 2020
