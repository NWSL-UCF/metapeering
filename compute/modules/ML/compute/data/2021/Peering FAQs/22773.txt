Internet Speed 101
Cox Internet Peering / Interconnection
Peering is a business relationship whereby operators of IP networks reciprocally exchange traffic sourced from each respective network through direct interconnectivity. Settlement-free peering is intended to be mutually beneficial.
Settlement-Free Peering Cox Communicationsâ (CCI) Settlement-Free Interconnection program is designed to handle the evolving Internet and reflects its current state. As Internet traffic delivery and associated economics change over time, Cox'sÂ peering program will evolve as well. All interested parties should review the guidelines for settlement-free peering. Potential Peers that meet the guidelines for settlement-free IP interconnection below should contactÂ peering@cox.com. Operators of networks that do not meet the guidelines for settlement-free IP interconnection can inquire about paid-peering.
Cox Communications Settlement-Free IP Interconnection Program
Companies requesting the establishment of settlement-free IP interconnection with Cox Communications should meet the following criteria:
Requesting Company must operate a nationwide IP network comprised primarily of 10 Gbps links Requesting Company must have a presence at two or more common interconnection locations (preferably at least one on the West Coast and one on the East Coast) in different US time zones. The locations listed onÂ as22773.peeringdb.comÂ are the most common locations, but Cox and Company may explore other mutually agreeable locations Requesting Company must maintain a minimum Internet traffic exchange of 1 Gbps measured at the 95th percentile with Autonomous System 22773 Requesting Company must enter into an IP Interconnection Agreement with Cox Requesting Company must have an experienced, professional Network Operations Center staffed 24/7/365 who have the ability to promptly remedy any issues Cox and Requesting Company shall work to maintain a balanced traffic scale between their respective networks. The network cost burden for connecting via local facilities should be roughly equal. Both companies shall agree to sustain equal financial burden for the costs of private interconnection via local facilities Requesting Company must be financially stable Cox and Requesting Company will interconnect for a trial period of up to 90 days for verification of traffic volume. After 90 days the parties may modify their Interconnection Agreement to reflect information learned during the trial period or agree to terminate Interconnection Company shall abide by the following routing policies (unless otherwise mutually agreed):
