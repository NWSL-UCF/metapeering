nerd modenerd modeInfrastructure > TechnologyA global backbone belonging to usIf the internet is important to you, then it all boils down to two key things: performance and availability. We are not a company that likes making compromises, and so we run our own IP backbone, which is a first-rate international data pipeline. Our backbone routers are sited in a variety of locations and linked together using multiple 10-gigabit fibre optic connections. In other words, we retain direct control over our own high-speed transfer of data to the greatest possible extent.The bits we can't handle ourselves are handled by our carefully chosen international carriers and around 8000 direct peering connections (direct connections to other networks). This enables us to achieve the shortest latency times and highest throughput rates in the world so that you can enjoy your Netflix streams, podcasts and Skype calls to the full.BlogPromoFAQAbout Init7ContactFine PrintJobsStatusMirrorInit7 on TwitterInit7 on Facebook
