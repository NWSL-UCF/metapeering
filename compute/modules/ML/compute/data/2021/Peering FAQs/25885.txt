FortiGuard Outbreak Alerts: what you need to know about the latest cybersecurity attacks
OPAQ (AS25885) Peering Policy
Networks wanting to peer with OPAQ must have the following:
Publicly routable ASN
Publicly routable address space (at least one /24 of IPv4 and/or one /48 of IPv6 space)
ASN record completed in PeeringDB
24×7 NOC contact capable of resolving BGP routing issues
Minimum traffic requirements as below
Traffic requirements – public peering
OPAQ generally does not have a minimum traffic requirement for public peering (subject to any specific market conditions).
OPAQ prefers to establish direct BGP sessions for traffic exchange instead of utilizing route-servers, where possible.
Traffic requirements – private peering
For networks with sufficient traffic (generally above 2 Gbps), OPAQ prefers private peering via datacenter cross connects using 10G LR.
Routing policy
In general, peering sessions with AS25885 will advertise all OPAQ and downstream customer routes originating in the applicable market.
At times, local infrastructure requirements or constraints may result in a more limited set of routes being advertised via AS25885.
Maximum prefixes
We suggest peers set a max-prefix of 500 (IPv4) and 100 (IPv6) routes on peering sessions with OPAQ.
PeeringDB
OPAQ’s PeeringDB entry can be found at https://www.peeringdb.com/net/2416
