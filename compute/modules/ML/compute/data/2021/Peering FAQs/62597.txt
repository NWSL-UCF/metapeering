AS62597 Peering Policy
AS62597 Peering Policy
NSONE (NS1) has a selective, but generally open peering policy - peers are selected based upon performance, capability, and where there is mutual benefit.
NSONE's general technical requirements for peering are:
A knowledgeable and fully staffed 24x7x365 Network Operations Center (NOC), capable of assisting in the resolution of:
All technical and performance issues.
All security violations, denial of service attacks, or any other abuse originating within the peer or their customers.
NSONE will overwrite received Multi-Exit Discriminators (MEDs) by default.
A publicly routable ASN.
At least one publicly routable /24 and/or /48
Current and complete peeringdb.com entry including a 24x7 NOC email role account and phone number.
Neither party shall establish a static route, a route of last resort, or otherwise send traffic to the other party for a route not announced via BGP.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported (and expected).
Both parties are expected to register their routes in a public Internet Routing Registry (IRR) database, for the purpose of filtering. Both parties shall make good faith efforts to keep this information up to date.
MD5 is not required, nor recommended.
Additional Routing Policy
NSONE may not advertise its anycast prefixes to peers depending on their geographic scope, whether they operate a backbone, and whether we peer in multiple locations.
NSONE does not operate a backbone and may advertise pop specific routes to peers in addition to anycast prefixes.
NSONE does not advertise anycast prefixes to route servers.
Filtering Policy
NSONE relies on IRR for prefix lists and as-path access lists:
Routes from ASNs not included in peers' AS-SET will be rejected.
Unregistered prefixes will be rejected.
