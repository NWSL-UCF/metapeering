SES Networks operates multiple discontiguous networks globally, each serving a Gateway used to connect to our satellite based network.

SES has seperate CIDR blocks for each discontigous network and only announces those CIDR blocks, and those of locally connected downstream ASes, to its peers for that particular discontiguous network.

SES uses a single ASN and disables AS loop detection on prefixes learnt from peers to enable this. 

Peering is welcomed at all locations where O3b connects to a peering exchange.
