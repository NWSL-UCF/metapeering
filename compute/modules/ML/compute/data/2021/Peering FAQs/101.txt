Routing Policy and BGP CommunitiesGeneralClient route filtering:All clients must inform the Network Operations Center of all prefixes that they intend to announce to ASN 101. ASN 101 utilizes an exact match philosophy when creating prefix filters.MED behavior:Deterministic MEDsDual-homed peer egress point selection:Nearest exitRFC 1918 addresses:Any route for RFC1918 address space will be rejected.Private use Autonomous Systems:Any route with a private use ASN in the path will be discarded.BGP community declarationsASN 101 will accept the following BGP communities from our clients:Containment101:10100 Do not announce to commodity internet101:10200 Do not announce to HPNSP (Internet2, etc.)101:10300 Do not announce to commodity peers101:10400 Do not announce to Research and Education network peersAS-PATH prepends101:11101 Prepend AS 101 once to commodity internet101:11102 Prepend AS 101 twice to commodity internet101:11103 Prepend AS 101 three times to commodity internet101:11201 Prepend AS 101 once to HPNSP (Internet2, etc.)101:11202 Prepend AS 101 twice to HPNSP (Internet2, etc.)101:11203 Prepend AS 101 three times to HPNSP (Internet2, etc.)101:11301 Prepend AS 101 once to commodity peers101:11302 Prepend AS 101 twice to commodity peers101:11303 Prepend AS 101 three times to commodity peers101:11401 Prepend AS 101 once to Research and Education network peers101:11402 Prepend AS 101 twice to Research and Education network peers101:11403 Prepend AS 101 three times to Research and Education network peerslocal-preference101:12000 Reduce local-preference to 80 inside AS 101AS 101 sets the following BGP communities on all outbound announcements to participants:101:20000 Route learned from a client of AS 101101:20100 Route learned from commodity internet service provider101:20200 Route learned from HPNSP (Internet2, etc.)101:20300 Route learned from a commodity peer101:20400 Route learned from a Research and Education network peerThis routing policy is subject to change without notice.Internet Routing Registry RequirementPNWGP requires all participants connecting using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that receive transit to the Commodity Internet or Internet2 to have all routes registered.All routes that BGP clients of PNWGP wish to be announced to AS101 (PNWGP) transit providers (i.e., ISPs, peers, and Internet2) must be registered in an Internet Routing Registry connected to RADB.PNWGP uses RADB, so the IRR that your organization selects must be RADB, or an IRR that the RADB project is mirroring.ALL BGP clients of PNWGP must inform the PNWGP NOC of the name of the Internet Routing registry object that should be incorporated into PNWGP's macro.Note: If the PNWGP participant network does not provide transit to any other network via BGP, the name of the IRR object is most likely the participant's Autonomous System (AS) number. If the PNWGP participant provides transit to other ASes, then in most circumstances an AS-SET object will likely be needed in order to properly announce networks connected to the other ASes.PNWGP participant changes to either their IRR object or routes that are described within the object will be processed on the following schedule:Changes in a client’s IRR object, such as renaming or replacement, will be processed within one business day from when the change request is acknowledged by the PNWGP Network Operations Center.Filter updates from IRR data will take place every business day, as needed. PNWGP re-synchronizes data daily from the IRR sources.Failure by a participant to register routes may result in impairment or unavailability of internet connectivity via PNWGP until the routes are registered and all of PNWGP's upstream providers update their filters. (Many providers update their routers automatically once a day, often early in the morning.)General information about Internet Routing Registries, including some tutorials, can be found at www.radb.net.Conditions of UsePacific Northwest Gigapop (PNWGP) participants will not use the Service in such a manner that:Jeopardizes the proper technical operation of the PNWGP network or infrastructureViolates the Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) or Conditions of Use (“CoU”) of an upstream PNWGP network provider as reported by that providerJeopardizes the resources of other PNWGP participants as reported by those participantsJeopardizes the PNWGP’s or UW’s reputation or the ability of either entity to conduct business in the manner to which it is accustomed.Any instance of the preceding shall be defined as a “Prohibited Activity.” In the event of a Prohibited Activity, PNWGP will make reasonable best efforts to contact the Participant’s designated representatives. In addition, PNWGP may take any appropriate corrective action–including the suspension of the offending or threatening connection–that it deems is warranted. PNWGP’s participants acknowledge PNWGP as the sole arbiter with respect to the forgoing.IPv6PNWGP's backbone is fully enabled for native IPv6 traffic. If you are not currently peering with PNWGP over IPv6 please contact the NOC to arrange for IPv6 peering.GrantsFrom time to time the Pacific Northwest Gigapop makes awards, grants and enters into contracts. In so doing, the Pacific Northwest Gigapop policy on awards, grants and contracts is that it will not pay any form of institutional overhead or indirect costs.Network NeutralityIt is the policy and commitment of the Pacific NorthWest Gigapop (PNWGP) to fully support, comply with, and advocate the principles of network neutralityPNWGP has always been, and remains, a strong believer in, and supporter of network neutrality and a truly open internet which is accessible to all, and which is free of all forms of network discrimination.PNWGP believes network neutrality to be an intrinsic requirement for providing the internet services our members, participants and collaborators want and deserve.PNWGP's network infrastructure, engineering and operations are, and will continue to be based upon the principles and philosophies of network neutrality.PNWGP complies with, state and other governmental regulations that support network neutrality.Please contact us for additional information or assistance. Urgent technical inquiries should be directed to the PNWGP Network Operations Center.
