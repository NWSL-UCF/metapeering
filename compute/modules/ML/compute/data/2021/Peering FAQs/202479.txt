Peering
AS202479 has an open peering policy, we peer with networks that have a presence on mutual exchange points in accordance with our peering policies.
We generally peer with the Route Server on any IXP we are present on. We highly encourage you to peer with us over the Route Server.
We announce regional (in-continent) prefixes to our peers and Upstreams.
If there is no mutual IXP, please consider peering with AS34927 and AS20473
Policy:
If there is a special Interest and/or a above normal traffic Exchanged between our network and your network, we are happy to set up a direct Peering over the IXP.
Your Network must have an up-to-date NOC contact email and phone contact, which is responsive to raised issues and concerns.
We reserve the following rights:
To change our policy and requirements at any time.
To accept or decline any request at any time for any reason.
To terminate any peering at any time without notice.
If you are interested in peering with us, please drop a mail at the NOC.
