We recommend that you set your max-prefix to 1,000.

If we have traffic to you, we will peer with you. Additionally we peer with Route Servers at any IX we connect to.

For traffic engineering purposes not all routes are advertised in all locations. Additionally some sessions within a region may only advertise a subset of routes.
