SETG (Southeast Texas GigaPOP) is a collaboration of universities, colleges, and K-12 schools in the Texas region that interconnects members to national R&E networks as well as CDNs and service providers.  Members are typically connected at 100Gbps with locations in Houston and Dallas.

SETG is the fastest path to deliver traffic to our researchers, faculty, students and staff.
