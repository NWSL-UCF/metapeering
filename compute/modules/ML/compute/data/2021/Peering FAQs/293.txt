Peering Connections
Overview
In accordance with BCP38, ESnet filters traffic from downstream networks through the use of packet filters.Â
To ensure BCP38 filters are kept up to date, downstream networks connecting to ESnet are required to publish and maintain accurate records of routing prefixes in use with ESnet.Â
To facilitate the ability of ESnet's peer networks to prevent the propagation of invalid routing prefixes, ESnet maintains objects in the Internet Routing Registry system as described below.
ESnet also filters routing prefixes from peers.Â  Peer networks connecting to ESnet are strongly encouraged to publish and maintain accurate records of routing prefixes in the IRR system, and ESnet may reject peering requests or de-peer networks if these records are not maintained.
