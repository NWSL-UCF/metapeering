NATO INTERNET SERVICE
About
AS46997 (formerly AS396303) is a network operated by Nato Research. Nato Internet Service is a non-profit project for
learning, education and research.
Our goal is to support the ever-growing internet community that wants to experiment and gain hands-on
experience with the real world BGP. We provide the following services:
Free IPv6 Allocation
Free IPv6 BGP Tunnel
Free LXC
w/ IPv6 BGP
temporarily unavailable
Looking for ASN registration? Looking for budget dedicated servers or colocation with IP transit? Take a look at our sponsor, AperNet.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support service at service.nat.moe.
Note: I am quite busy lately; responses to non-emergency tickets (tunnel requests, IP requests) may be delayed up to 30 days. Feel free to open new tickets. I will process them as soon as I can.
