About
AS34553 is the primary network operated by Nate Sales (me!) for the purpose of supporting the development of
education, research, open source, and amateur radio related projects. If you're looking for infrastructure or
other services for your project, feel free to reach out.
The network is separated into 2 logical sections, the core and the CDN. CDN routes are announced anycast at all
PoPs and IXPs, and core routes are local to a specific PoP and it's directly connected IXPs. CDN routes are
announced into the core but not the other way around. Core PoPs have an open peering policy and CDN-only PoPs
have a selective peering policy. All ASNs in the cone that may be announced at any AS34553 PoP are contained in
AS34553:AS-ALL.

Filtering
AS34553 uses bcg, a custom automation system, on most routers. For
specific information relating to filtering policies, check out the README.
All originated prefixes have route objects in place. IRR objects are in their respective RIR's IRRDB, or ALTDB
for AMPRNet prefixes. All prefixes except for AMPRNet space are covered by RPKI ROAs. AMPRNet is legacy
space and cannot be signed at the present time. RPKI invalids are unconditionally rejected on all sessions.
