We maintain BGP sessions with route server(s) in each public internet exchange where we have a presence. All public prefixes from the SendGrid site most local to the exchange are advertised to the route servers, and this is our preferred interconnection method in most cases.

Networks with unique requirements which cannot be satisfied by route servers may contact the peering address listed below to discuss establishing a bilateral session.
