MenuIPTP Networks / About Us / Legal / Peering PolicyPeering PolicyCandidates (hereinafter referred to as âPeersâ) who would like to establish settlement-free peering with IPTP Networks (hereinafter referred to as âIPTPâ) shall review and agree to both (1) Network Requirements and (2) Operational Requirements stated in this peering policy.1. NETWORK REQUIREMENTS1.1 Public Peering Peers who would like to take part in public peering are required to fulfill the following requirements:1.1.1 Peering scope Peers shall have the ability and agree to peer at all markets that both IPTP and the Peers are commonly present. IPTP will also consider to peer on a single continent if the Peerâs network spans within the same continent.1.1.2 Traffic volume Peers shall have a minimum of 200Mbps and maximum of 500Mbps peak exchange traffic with IPTP through any exchange point. Traffic above 500Mbps peak shall be considered and discussed as a private peering option.1.1.3 Prefix advertisement Peers are required to advertise consistent routes over all the peering sessions, on all continents. A minimum of 10 unique routes are expected from peers. Any route longer than /24 (IPv4) or /64 (IPv6) will be discarded.1.1.4 Accessibility Peers who are connected with existing customer(s) or peering partner(s) of IPTP within recent 6 months at the time of peering request are not eligible for free-settlement peering.1.2 Private Peering Peers who would like to take part in private peering are required to fulfill all requirements stated for public peering in addition to those for private peering listed below:1.2.1 Network Capacity Peers are required to have a backbone with a minimum of two OC-48’s/10G circuits between any two backbone cities.1.2.2 Circuit utilization Peers shall have the ability to interconnect directly with IPTP at a minimum of 1000Mbps capacity, or greater. Circuit utilization shall always be equal to or higher than 25% and be below 80%. Alternatively, peers shall consider public peering or a capacity upgrade.1.2.3 Prefix advertisement Peers are required to advertise consistent routes over all the peering sessions, on all continents. Full customer routes and a minimum of 1000 unique routes are expected from peers. Any route longer than /24 (IPv4) or /64 (IPv6) will be discarded.2. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS2.1 Peers must operate a 24×7 Network Operations Center (NOC) or equivalent that capable of resolving issues related to BGP, routing, security or abuse within 48 hours.2.2 Peers must operate a network with sufficient redundancy and capacity. Any failure of a single node will not significantly affect the overall network performance.2.3 Peers and IPTP should not point default into or provides transit to the other networks at any time.2.4 The ratio of traffic exchanging between peers and IPTP should roughly balanced and shall not exceed 8:1 in both directions.2.5 Peers and IPTP shall monitor the usage of all interconnection links. If the utilization of any link exceed 80% for a period of at least one hour for three consecutive days, both parties shall work together to increase link capacity or to reroute traffic in order to reduce the utilization.2.6 Peers and IPTP shall accept the responsibility for communicating with their respective customers concerning the network and services that each company provides to them.2.7 Peers shall notify IPTP for any planned maintenance at least 48 hours in advance. Notification message should state clearly the date, time, and impact of the maintenance.2.8 Peers and IPTP shall conduct periodic capacity and link quality review in order to accommodate traffic growth and minimize the possibility of latency increase or packet loss between networks.2.9 Peers who disagree or unable to meet the requirements listed in sections 1 & 2 will be placed into the de-peer list. Upon any serious operational issues including but not limited to: incosistent routes causing suboptimal routing, prefix leaks, the Peer will be given up 30 day(s) notice to remedy the situation. Immediate de-peering may occur if no action is taken.IPTP will review and update the peering policy from time to time without further notice and reserves the right to
(a) Accept or refuse any peering request, whether or not peers meet these requirements;
(b) Terminate peering relationship at any time with 30 days notice
