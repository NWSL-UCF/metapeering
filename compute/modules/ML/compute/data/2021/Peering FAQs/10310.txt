Peering Policy
Oath Global Network Interconnection (“Peering”) Policy and RequirementsOath Network is a global network with POP (point of presence) locations across North and South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. Oath Network peers with other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Content Networks with IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity on Autonomous System (AS) 10310 for the purpose of exchanging traffic with those networks.Selective Peering PolicyOath Network has a selective but generally open peering policy - peers are selected based upon performance, capability, and where traffic needs to be delivered. Peers are subject to certain operational, technical, and legal requirements.Operational RequirementsTo maintain optimum service levels for our customers and their clientele, peers shall meet the following set of requirements:Exchange traffic with Oath Network at all available IXPs that are shared in common for optimal traffic distribution and redundancy.Maintain congestion free interconnection with Oath Network. Oath Network and peers must work quickly and diligently to augment capacity between networks or to the relevant IXP, as needed.Must maintain a Network Operations Center capable of responding operational problems and security incidents 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.Be responsive to activities considered malicious and/or detrimental to the Internet as a whole, its own network, and to its customers, including but not limited to, sending unsolicited bulk email, hacking, advertising incorrect routing information, and denial of service. Oath Network expects peers to provide a qualified engineer to help trace and mitigate attacks in a reasonable amount of time.Provide an escalation path for resolving operational problems and/or security incidents in a timely fashion.Meet all requirements at the time the peering request is made, and must continue to meet these requirements as long as the peering sessions remain configured.Due to the nature of our Network (Content Delivery Network), we:Scope our routing announcements according to the point of interconnect; providing access to local market POP specific prefixes as well as selected regional and/or global anycast prefixes.Do not announce a consistent set of prefixes across IXPs. Peers will not receive a consistent routing table from Oath Network. across multiple regions unless agreed by both parties and the peer is present on all locations.Have a predominantly outbound traffic profile.Technical RequirementsThe following technical requirements also apply to peering with Oath Network. Peers must:Have a publicly routed ASN.Not advertise prefixes with a mask longer than /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6Demonstrate that announced publicly routable prefixes and/or aggregates are currently visible in the DFZAnnounce a consistent set of prefixes to Oath Network. at all points of interconnection, unless otherwise agreed upon.Only send traffic destined for prefixes announced by Oath Network.Not point a default route at Oath Network or use static routes to send traffic to our AS.Set default maximum prefixes per session to 2000 prefixes for IPv4 and 250 prefixes for IPv6, or to the currently posted values in http://as10310.peeringdb.org/, whichever are larger.Register their prefixes with appropriate route/route6 objects at an appropriate IRRDB. Oath Network, will use this data to build BGP prefix lists.If appropriate or required, prefix lists and as-path lists shall be generated from the AS-Macro AS-YAHOO registered with the RADB.We highly recommend our peers to maintain a full and accurate PeeringDB listing for their network and point of presence details.Important NoticesTo ensure quality of operations, Oath Network , reserves the following rights under its Peering Policy and Requirements:To alter our peering policy and peering requirements at any time.To accept or decline a peering request at any time for any reason.To suspend, without notice, peering connectivity in the event that a severe quality of service issue such as high latency, packet loss, or jitter pattern is detected, and to take appropriate traffic engineering steps to maintain service quality.To selectively withdraw prefixes from public IXP fabrics as needed to protect service quality.To terminate any peering connection at any time without notice.Additionally:By advertising prefixes to Yahoo! Inc. a peer will expressly waive any right to compensation for accepting / delivering traffic originated from Yahoo! Inc.’s ASN.Peers with significant traffic with the Yahoo! Inc. AS will be considered for bilateral sessions via IXPs or private (cross-connect) peering.
