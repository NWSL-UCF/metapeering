ASN 7850 / CityLink
Welcome to our BGP routing site for ASN 7850. Â The purpose of this site is to document how AS7850 connects with transit providers, peers and customers. Â We will further document how and what community tags we set and listen to.
The site is a dull and dry site that talks about technical aspects of our BGP configurations. Â We have some configuration examples and links to additional technical data. Â This site is not intended to teach BGP. We assume you already know much about BGP.
Information on exchanges we connect to and places for private peering please see:
