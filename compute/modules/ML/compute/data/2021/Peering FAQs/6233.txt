Peering Policy
Summary
This document describes the peering policies for xTom (AS3214, AS4785, AS6233, AS9312, AS23858, AS35537, AS36828, AS62805, AS328383).
Background
An Internet exchange point (IX or IXP) is the physical infrastructure through which Internet service providers (ISPs) and content delivery networks (CDNs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks. (Wikipedia)
Policy Statement
xTom will peer with network operators at IXs for anyone. Our inclination is to setup multiple peering sessions for redundancy wherever and at whatever point conceivable. xTom will also peer with router servers on all IXs where we are available.
Peering Requirements
To be eligible for peering, each candidate must:
Use a registered public autonomous system (AS) number;
Publish valid contact information via PeeringDB
Maintain valid AS and prefix records with a public Internet Routing Registry (IRR).
A peer may only send toward us traffic intended for a destination network we advertise. The use of static or default routes toward us is not permitted.
The following features not required but we can configure if you need:
RFC 2385—BGP MD5 authentication
RFC 7999—BLACKHOLE community
RFC 8326—Graceful BGP session shutdown
Peering with xTom on Internet Exchanges
No traffic volume required. We are open to peer with anyone.
BGP sessions should be established in IPv4 and IPv6 if available.
Peering with xTom on Private Peering
Our BGP peering policy is open, but for PNI, we start with 10GB-LR or 100GB-LR4 interfaces.
Traffic with the peer ASN should be at least around 5Gbps peak to start discussing about PNI.
BGP sessions should be established in IPv4 and IPv6 if available
xTom provides IPv4 /31 and IPv6 /64 networks for the PNI
Maximum Prefixes
We suggest to set the following maximum-prefixes:
IPv4 : 1000 prefixes
IPv6 : 1000 prefixes
