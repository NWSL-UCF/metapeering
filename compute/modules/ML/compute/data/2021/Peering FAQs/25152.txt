K-root Peering Policy

https://www.ripe.net/logo.png
K-root Peering Policy
K-root originates all our prefixes from AS25152.
We operate a generally open peering policy.
This is subject to certain operational policies, which are detailed below:
Core (Global) nodes
At our Core nodes, we accept all prefixes from IXP route servers, subject to a minimum size (IPv4: /24, IPv6: /48). We advertise all our prefixes to the IXP route servers. We encourage peering partners to use the IXP route servers to reduce administration overhead.
If you do not normally peer with the IXP route servers (due to your own policy), we encourage you to use the IXP route servers filtering communities to restrict prefix advertisements to our ASN.
We will also consider direct peering requests, provided your routes are not also visible via the IXP route servers.
Below is a list of our Core (Global) nodes
Amsterdam (nl-ams) - AMS-IX & NL-IX
Frankfurt (de-fra) - DE-CIX
London (gb-lon) - LINX (Juniper and Extreme LANs) & LONAP
Miami (us-mia) - NAP Of The Americas (NOTA)
Tokyo (jp-tyo) - JPNAP & DIX-IE
Hosted (IX) nodes
At our Hosted (IX) nodes, we accept all prefixes from IXP route servers, subject to a minimum size (IPv4: /24, IPv6: /48). We advertise all our prefixes to the IXP route servers. We encourage peering partners to use the IXP route servers to reduce administration overhead.
If you do not normally peer with the IXP route servers (due to your own policy), we encourage you to use the IXP route servers filtering communities to restrict prefix advertisements to our ASN.
We will only consider direct peerings in locations that do not have IXP route servers.
Our Hosted (IX) nodes are those which are present on IXPs, but are not in the list of Core (Global) nodes above.

RSSAC 002 Metrics
ICANN's Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) has published a document, RSSAC002, that requests root name server operators to collect and publish certain key metrics about the root name server system. K-root's statistics are available at the following address:
RSSAC 002 Metrics
DSC Graphs
These graphs show the query rate at K-root. The first graph shows the combined rate across all K-root nodes. The next four show combined query rates for the four different categories of K-root nodes. Clicking on the graphs will show more details.
