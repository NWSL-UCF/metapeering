Get in touch with us.Contact us+1 877-334-3236Peering with us.To ensure your content is delivered quickly and reliably, our Super PoPs are placed inside data centers where major backbone and last-mile providers peer with each other. We have also established direct interconnection (peering) arrangements with most of the major eyeball networks. This prevents your content from having to travel over multiple “hops” to reach your consumers. Physically placing our caching servers at the carrier interconnection points, while peering with those same carriers—enables us to offer high-speed, high-performance delivery services to even the most remote geographies.We want our customers to enjoy an exceptional web experience. We carefully choose where we put our servers, how many and which data centers we work with. We’re also purposeful in the kinds of business relationships we cultivate with our Internet Service Provider partners. Having the right interconnections ensures that we offer the best web performance to our customers. We’ve therefore taken the following three approaches when it comes to peering and interconnections:Public PeeringWe participate at public Internet Exchanges (IXs) all across the globe, on every continent except Antarctica. Our ability to peer with carriers and networks, both small and large, boosts the performance of our customers’ websites and digital content delivery. We have a completely open peering policy and set up public peering in as many locations as possible with each network, which gives us diversity and disaster recovery options so our customers don’t get impacted by outages. All of our locations are listed at http://as15133.peeringdb.com/, and we would be happy to set up public peering with any network. Just email us at peering@verizondigitalmedia.com to get started.Private PeeringThe Verizon Media Platform also uses private peering interconnections with eyeball networks at mutual locations around the world. Private peering is a very reliable and secure way of delivering our customers’ content to users on various networks. It also improves the network’s cost efficiency when dealing with large amounts of traffic as they can take our traffic in the most efficient and direct manner. If an important network is not physically located where our Super PoPs are, we will  either embed our equipment in their premises or place our technology at an internet handoff location to improve quality for our customers. To find out more about private peering with us, reach out to peering@verizondigitalmedia.com.Bilateral Interconnect AgreementThis type of interconnection agreement is used for networks that exchange traffic with Verizon and Verizon Media on a larger scale. It's put in place to ensure both networks prevent congestion on interconnection links by augmenting capacity ahead of congestion at set intervals based on growth rates and forecasts. This helps ensure the highest level of performance and quality for our customers and the network in which we connect. We have in-depth planning meetings with these partner networks to ensure we are connecting in the right places and in the right manner, with a focus on delivering content at the highest quality. This is open to any network in the world and run by our Carrier Relations team reachable at CarrierRelations@verizondigitalmedia.com.About UsOur brandsCareersPressAd specsOffice locationsBrand TrustPrivacy policyTerms of serviceMedia Platform PoliciesAbout our adsCode of ConductBusiness & human rightsPrivacy dashboardContact UsAOL member helpYahoo account helpAccessibilityAdvertiseContact Verizon MediaBroadcast with UsFind the right broadcasting solutions for your businessLearn moreJoin UsSpend every day connecting people with the things they loveSearch jobsSearch jobsFollow Us© 2021 Verizon Media.
