AS29697 Peering Policy
Posted by Barry Bahrami on 20 May 2018 11:01 AM
CNS (AS29697) operates an open network.  Our routes are available on all route servers at Internet Traffic Exchanges where we have a presence.  At our sole discretion, CNS will generally agree to setup a private peering session when required and in situations where it will benefit our mutual users.
In cases where private peering is established, we typically require peering at all points where we share a common POP.We are listed in PeeringDB at https://www.peeringdb.com/net/6611
For peering inquiries, please contact NOC (at) CommercialNetworkServices.com and put "peering" in the subject.
