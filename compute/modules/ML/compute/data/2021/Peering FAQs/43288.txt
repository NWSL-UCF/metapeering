Peering Policy
At Simeon Networks, we believe that the key to an open and scalable internet is to encourage as much Settlement-Free Interconnect (SFI) peering as possible. We understanding that open peering is not always possible. Thus, we employ a mostly open peering policy. We will peer with all non-malicious and non-abusive ASNs. Sometimes, we limit some of our routes depending on geography and traffic levels.
