AS112 nodes announce anycast prefixes and are operated by many people around the world. We try to collect the IXP connected AS112 nodes here.

As everyone can operate an AS112 node without telling anyone else it's not possible to have all the contacts listed here. There is a [mailing list](https://lists.dns-oarc.net/mailman/listinfo/as112-ops) where operators can subscribe to.

There are also more nodes outside of IXPs. The project tries to [list them](https://www.as112.net/ops-listing.html), but as it is not mandatory to tell the project about your AS112 node the list is not complete.
