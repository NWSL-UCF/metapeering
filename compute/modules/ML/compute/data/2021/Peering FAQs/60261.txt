Peering
Limelight Networks interconnection policy seeks to enhance its global connectivity to other networks. Interconnection with any partner network should be mutually beneficial and meet certain technical criteria. Limelight Networks practices a ‘selective’ peering policy.
Limelight Networks Public/Private Peering Common Guidelines:
MUST peer in all common locations, including "home markets".
MUST peer in multiple locations; geographic relevance is considered.
MUST announce routes consistently.
MUST actively pursue trouble ticket resolution.
MUST NOT point default, reset next hop, or advertise third party routes.
MUST exchange a minimum of 1 Gbps in dominant direction.
MUST peer with both IPv4 and IPv6 (dualstack).
MUST maintain up-to-date contact info at peeringdb.com.
Additional requirements for Private Peering:
MUST be able to interconnect at 10G or 100G Ethernet port capacities. Limelight supports use of LR and ER optics at both speeds. 1G connects are not supported.
MUST be able to discuss capacity and expansion plans at least once a year during known industry events (NOGs, Peering Forums etc.) or through directly scheduled calls.
Share the cost of cross connects.
