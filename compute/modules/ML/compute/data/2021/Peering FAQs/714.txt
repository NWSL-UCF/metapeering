If interested in hosting an Apple Edge Cache (AEC) in your network, please submit a request via https://cache.edge.apple

We have a generally open peering policy but require peers to maintain an accurate peeringdb entry for all peering requests. 

Peeringdb entry must include: ASN, IX information with configuration details and contact information for both NOC & Peering/Policy.

We also ask that peers include their private peering options for private peering (PNI) targeting.

Additional information about Apple services: https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus

Please send all peering requests including ASN to peering@group.apple.com
