NORDUnet is a not-for-profit research and education network serving all research and higher education institutions in the Nordic countries, The Baltics, Poland, The Netherlands and Russia. Peering with NORDUnet provides connectivity to all researchers, students and educational institutions in these countries.

NORDUnet only serves the international academic community and does not provide connectivity or services to commercial networks.

We do require a updated PeeringDB-entry to be eligble to peer with NORDUnet. All peering is automated and is continuously monitored with the support of the data in PeeringDB. 

We also do require that the peering-partner peers with both IPv4 and IPv6.

We do honor GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community 65535:0 on all eBGP-peering sessions which will set the received route on local-preference 0. 

We will perform latency-tests towards every peer to figure whether or not this is a local or remote-connection. We very rarely peer with remote and/or participants stretched beyond a metro-connection to the exchange.

We assume that everyone we peer with updates their IRR-record continuously since we do filtering on all inbound sessions with us based upon the data in the IRR dataset. We reserve the right to de-peer anyone that do not filter their own customers and do not honor BCP38 or in any other way misbehaves the built-in trust we have of operating BGP in the Default Free Zone.
