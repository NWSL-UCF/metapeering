In general, Centauri maintains a reasonably open peering policy
and is willing to peer with other networks across public peering
points where both networks are present.
There are however certain
requirements which will be described below
Centauri is primarily interested in peering with
networks of similar size, where multiple geographically diverse
interconnections are possible.
All peers must supply an Operational contact that is available
on a 24x7 basis, such as a Network Operations Center or equivalent.
Both Voice and Email contact information is required.
Peers must not utilize any form of gateway of last resort or
default route that is directed at Centauri Communications
Use of the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is strongly encouraged
for prompt prefix filter updates.
Networks that do not provide
a Routing Registry object to use for filter generation may
have all routes filtered based upon some arbitrary criteria,
such as mask length, or number of prefixes announced.
Centauri maintains the right to add an entry describing any
peering interconnect into the Internet Routing Registry system
for the purpose of easing BGP filter generation..
Peers should provide access to a looking glass or traceroute
server to facilitate troubleshooting.
A good faith effort should be made to aggregate route announcements
as much as practical.
All announcements are to be consistent, in terms of prefix aggregation
properties, across all interconnect locations.
Peers are expected to filter their clients to reject both
unauthorized BGP announcements as well as IP datagrams with
invalid source addresses.
Under no circumstances will Centauri maintain both a transit
and peering relationship with a given network simultaneously.
Centauri reserves the right to suspend peering for an indefinite
period of time should any form of network abuse be verified to
take place via the peering interconnect.
The following non-exhaustive
list serves to provide examples of such abuse:
Denial of Service attacks
Unsolicited Bulk Email sources
Setting default-route to Centauri Communications
Final decision in peering is based upon a mutually
agreeable decision to peer based upon operational needs. If
Centauri Communications operational needs cause a peering arrangement to
conflict with the best interest of Centauri, Centauri reserves
the right to terminate the peering agreement with reasonable
advance notice.
