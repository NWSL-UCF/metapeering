We service users in the multiple tens of thousands through our national network, including many large medical facilities and health care centric multibillion dollar enterprises. We also archive a constantly increasing number of petabytes of medical images for numerous hospitals' PACS systems. If you have customers that are in the medical industry, or provide hosted services to doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, labs or other similar entities, you'll likely be exchanging traffic with us and will want to peer. We currently have several core markets supported by datacenters in Northwestern New Jersey, Plano, TX, Quincy, WA, and Cincinnati, OH. Our public peering efforts are focused in these markets.\n\nPlease note, we no longer have a network presence in Los Angeles, CA. Please remove any sessions you may have with us on any exchanges in this area.\n\nWe have an open peering policy, but heavily prefer having peering in all key markets if your network also spans these regions in order to minimize latency.", "notes_private": "", "org_id": 2869, "policy_contracts": "Not Required", "policy_general": "Open", "policy_locations": "Preferred", "policy_ratio": 0, "policy_url": "", "route_server": "", "status": "ok", "updated": "2016-05-27 10:58:01.154013", "version": 0, "website": "http://www.dell.com/healthcare", "pop_list": [{"city": "Philadelphia", "country": "US", "state": "PA", "org_name": "Cross Connect Solutions", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 366, "location": [32.24, -84.31], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.782}, {"city": "New York", "country": "US", "state": "NY", "org_name": "Telx New York", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 325, "location": [40.72, -74.01], "port_capacity": 3000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "ix", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.802}, {"city": "Dallas", "country": "US", "state": "TX", "org_name": "Equinix", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 4, "location": [32.8, -96.82], "port_capacity": 2000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8170000000000001}, {"city": "Seattle", "country": "US", "state": "WA", "org_name": "Equinix", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 86, "location": [47.61, -122.34], "port_capacity": 2000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.885}, {"city": "Newark", "country": "US", "state": "NJ", "org_name": "Level 3 Communications, LLC", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 1601, "location": [40.74, -74.17], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.8240000000000001}, {"city": "Cincinnati ", "country": "US", "state": "OH", "org_name": "CyrusOne", "isp_id_in_peering_db": 1467, "location": [39.1, -84.52], "port_capacity": 1000, "isp_type_in_peering_db": "fac", "internet_penetration_percentage": 0.794}], "prefixes": 9, "total_prefixes_in_globe": 8388478, "address_space": 32768, "total_addresses_in_globe": 22264797636, "neighbor": 7}
